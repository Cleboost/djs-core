Welcome to **Docus**, a fully integrated documentation solution built with [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com).

## What is Djs-core?

Djs-core is a framework for creating Discord bots with TypeScript. It uses a routing system inspired by frameworks like Nuxt or Next, leveraging a file system-based router to define your bot's structure. Additionally, it automatically manages data flows that developers would otherwise need to handle manually.
