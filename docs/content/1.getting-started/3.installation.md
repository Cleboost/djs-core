## From quickstart

::steps
### Create github repo from template

Go to the [quickstart](https://github.com/here-template/Bot-Discord) repository and click on the `Use this template` button.

### Install dependencies

```bash [Terminal]
bun install
```

### Setup environment variables

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set your Discord bot token ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)):

```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
```

### Start your bot

```bash [Terminal]
bun run start
```
::

## From scratch

Set up a new djs-core project from scratch with complete control over your project structure.

::steps
### Initialize your project

Create a new Bun project:

```bash [Terminal]
bun init
```

This creates a basic `package.json` and initializes your project structure.

### Install dependencies

Install djs-core packages:

```bash [Terminal]
bun i -D @djs-core/dev
bun i @djs-core/runtime
```

::tip
- `@djs-core/dev` is a dev dependency providing build tools and CLI commands
- `@djs-core/runtime` is the runtime library containing the framework logic
- Make sure you also have `discord.js` installed: `bun i discord.js`
::

### Add scripts to package.json

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json [package.json]
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "djs-core dev",
    "build": "djs-core build",
    "start": "djs-core start"
  }
}
```

::field-group
  ::field{name="dev" type="script"}
  Runs the bot in development mode with hot reload - automatically restarts when files change
  ::
  
  ::field{name="build" type="script"}
  Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `dist/` folder for production
  ::
  
  ::field{name="start" type="script"}
  Runs the compiled bot from the `dist/` folder (use after `build`)
  ::
::

### Create configuration file

Create a `djs.config.ts` file in your project root:

```typescript [djs.config.ts]
import type { Config } from "@djs-core/dev";

if (!process.env.TOKEN) {
  throw new Error("TOKEN environment variable is required");
}

export default {
  token: process.env.TOKEN,
  servers: ["YOUR_GUILD_ID"],
} satisfies Config;
```

::field-group
  ::field{name="token" type="string"}
  Your Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  ::
  
  ::field{name="servers" type="string[]"}
  Array of guild (server) IDs where commands should be registered. Use an empty array `[]` for global commands (takes up to 1 hour to propagate).
  ::
::

::warning
Never commit your bot token to version control! Store it in a `.env` file and add `.env` to your `.gitignore`.
::

### Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env [.env]
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
```

Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore [.gitignore]
.env
node_modules/
dist/
```

### Create your first command

Create the directory structure and your first command:

```typescript [src/interactions/commands/ping.ts]
import { Command } from "@djs-core/runtime";

export default new Command()
  .setDescription("Ping the bot")
  .run(async (interaction) => {
    await interaction.reply("Pong!");
  });
```

::tip
The command name is automatically derived from the file path. `src/interactions/commands/ping.ts` becomes `/ping` in Discord.
::

### Start your bot

Run your bot in development mode:

```bash [Terminal]
bun run dev
```

Your bot should now be online and the `/ping` command should be available in Discord!

::note
In development mode, commands are automatically registered when the bot starts. You'll see console output indicating which commands were registered.
::
::
