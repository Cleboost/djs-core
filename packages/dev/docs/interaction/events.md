Event listeners are defined in the `src/events/` directory. Each file should export a default `EventListener` instance.

```typescript [src/events/ready.ts]
import { EventListener } from "@djs-core/runtime";
import { Events, ActivityType } from "discord.js";

export default new EventListener()
  .event(Events.ClientReady)
  .run((client) => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
    client.user.setActivity({ name: "over your server", type: ActivityType.Watching });
  });
```

### Key Methods

- `.event(Events.EventName)`: Specifies which Discord event to listen for.
- `.run((client, ...args) => { ... })`: The function that executes when the event is fired. It receives the `client` and any event-specific arguments.Docs WIP

<Tip>
  `Ready` event is auto replaced by `Events.ClientReady` event. `Ready` are [depreacted](https://discordjs.guide/v15#ready-event).
