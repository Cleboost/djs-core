This is the minimal directory structure for a djs-core Discord bot project:

```text
my-bot/
├── src/
│   ├── interactions/
│   │   ├── commands/       # Slash commands (/ping, /admin kick)
│   │   ├── contexts/       # Context menus (User, Message)
│   │   │   ├── user/
│   │   │   └── message/
│   ├── events/             # discord.js event listeners (ready, messageCreate)
│   └── components/         # Reusable interaction components
│       ├── buttons/
│       ├── modals/
│       └── selects/
├── djs.config.ts           # Core configuration
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

### `src/` directory

This is where you organize your bot's code using the file-based routing system.

<Tip>
The file-based routing system means the structure of your files determines how commands, components, and events are registered. Keep your files organized to match your bot's functionality.
</Tip>

#### `src/interactions/commands/`

This directory contains your slash commands. Each file automatically becomes a command, and subdirectories create command groups.

- **File Path → Command Name Mapping**:
  - `ping.ts` → `/ping`
  - `admin/kick.ts` → `/admin kick`
  - `shop/buy.ts` → `/shop buy`

#### `src/interactions/contexts/`

This directory contains your context menu commands (user and message context menus).

- `user/` - User context menus (right-click on users).
- `message/` - Message context menus (right-click on messages).

#### `src/events/`

This directory contains your Discord event handlers. Common events include:
- `ready.ts` - Fired when the bot connects to Discord.
- `messageCreate.ts` - Fired when a message is created.
- `guildMemberAdd.ts` - Fired when a member joins a server.

#### `src/components/`

This directory contains reusable interaction components:
- `buttons/` - Interactive clickable buttons.
- `modals/` - Form-like dialogs with text inputs.
- `selects/` - Select menu components (string, user, role, channel, mentionable).

### `djs.config.ts`

The configuration file for your bot. It defines settings like your token and server IDs.

### `package.json`

Contains dependencies and scripts. Essential dependencies include `@djs-core/runtime` and `discord.js`.

### `tsconfig.json`

TypeScript configuration for the project.
